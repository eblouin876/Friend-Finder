# Friend-Finder

## Description
This is a command line program built off of node. It allows the user to query for information on movies, songs, and bands in the area via the command line orr by modifying random.txt

## Languages and Modules Used
* Javascript
* DotEnv
* fs
* express
* path
* Materialize
* Async/Await (made the query.js module functional)

## Support
If you come across any bugs or have any suggestions to improve the code, please feel free to comment! 

## Project Status
This project is part of a web development program I am currently enrolled in and is in the works. I will continue to improve upon it over the next few months. Directions at the moment include: 
* Improving the look of the UI
* Removing the hard coded html that is returned and passing it to another html page instead
* Updating using handlebars to make the code cleaner
